# Ways to install Node

One of the things you'll need on your local machine is [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) (also known as Node.js, Nodejs)

It's a very common piece of technology and is very safe to have on your machine.

If you've been working with TOP, you most likely already have it.

You'll need to have a specific version (specifically, version 16 or greater).

To find if you have Node on your machine right now and/or what version of Node is currently active, open the command line (Terminal, Kitty, iTerm, VS Code integrated terminal, etc) and type the following command anywhere:

```bash
node -v
```
If any version of Node is installed, the terminal will output something like this:

```bash
v14.15.0
```
This means Node is installed and is currently using version 14.15.0.

Since this project requires Node version 16 or greater, let's check if there are more than one versions of Node already on the local machine.

To have more than 1 version of Node, there must be a version manager for Node.

This requires another tool called Node Version Manager (NVM).

To determine if Node Version Manager (NVM) is installed locally, run the following command in the command line:


```bash
nvm
```

If Node Version Manager (NVM) is already installed, the command line will output something similar to this:

```bash
# don't read or memorize this
# use this to compare the output of your machine
# if your machine has something similar you have NVM already

Node Version Manager (v0.39.5)

Note: <version> refers to any version-like string nvm understands. This includes:
  - full or partial version numbers, starting with an optional "v" (0.10, v0.1.2, v1)
  - default (built-in) aliases: node, stable, unstable, iojs, system
  - custom aliases you define with `nvm alias foo`

 Any options that produce colorized output should respect the `--no-colors` option.

Usage:
  nvm --help                                  Show this message
    --no-colors                               Suppress colored output

Note:
  to remove, delete, or uninstall nvm - just remove the `$NVM_DIR` folder (usually `~/.nvm`)

```

If NVM is not installed on your machine, Google "install NVM mac"

To list the versions of node already installed locally, run the following command:

```bash
nvm ls
```
If a version greater than 16 is already installed, run the following command:

```bash
nvm use v18.13.0
```

If a version greater than 16 does not already exist, run the following command:

```bash
nvm install node
```
then switch to use the latest version (by following previous steps listed).
