# Setup

Below is a list of steps you must take to get the project up and running in a local environment.

1. Clone the organization onto your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:club-40/odin-pantry.git
```

2. Navigate your computer/command line into the odin-pantry organization repository

```bash
cd odin-pantry
```

3. Navigate into the odin-pantry `frontend/` repository

```bash
cd frontend
```

4. If necessary, Install the proper version of Node (As of 1/27/2024, you'll need Node version 16 or greater - to avoid issues, it's recommended to install the most recent version of Node). [How to install the proper version of Node]()
