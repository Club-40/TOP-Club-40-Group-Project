### TBD [Scaffold]

- Zustand: Consider using [Zustood](https://zustood.netlify.app/)? Zustand can get messy and having a simple, given, modular stucture with immer, devtools and state persistence is very nice. This needs to be decided before writing code for Zustand. Also, how it will work with react-query and vitest.

- Storybook: TBD

- React Query: TBD

- Vitest: Extensions, devtools and scaffold patterns - what features are we planning and how are they gonna co-exist with storybook?

- ci: TBD on eslint action and adding concurrency to all of them to save minutes

- commitlint: TBD [This commitlint is crap]
