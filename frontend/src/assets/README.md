### `/src/assets`

This section is responsible for having a neat and organised structure for all the required media/audio/miscellaneous assets that the UI may require. Going ahead, organising this with folders earmarked with different assets would be a good practice.

More assets may be available in `public/` but it is prefered to be using this section instead, for use in the UI directly.

- `/images/*`: `.webp` images would be preferable, considering wide support in the face of Edge not supporting `.avif` formats.
- `/audio/*`, `/video/*`, ...: TBD
