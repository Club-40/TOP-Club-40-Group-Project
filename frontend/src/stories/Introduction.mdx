# Welcome to The Odin Pantry's Storybook

This contains visualization for the Style Guide and Components developed within the project.

## Paths

- **Design** - contains documentation or stories about the styles and patterns that is used within the project
- **Components** - contains all components developed in the project
- **Pages** - contains all pages developed in the project

## Creating a story

First, we will need to create a new file with the format: `ComponentName.stories.tsx` and inside that file we will need to import the following:

```tsx
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
import Component from './Component';
```

We also need a default export for the Meta for this Component story

```tsx
export default {
  // Add Components/ and the Component name after the forward slash
  // So that all components are in a single story path
  title: 'Components/Component Name',
  // To auto generate documentation
  tags: ['autodocs'],
  component: Component
} satisfies Meta<typeof Component>;
```

And we can finally create a story for that component by doing:

```tsx
type Story = StoryObj<typeof Component>;

export const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    // Props of the component
    propOne: '...',
    propTwo: '...'
  },
};
```

To know more about the recommended way of creating story check out [storybook's documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf).

## Adding interactiong testing in stories

Unfortunately, there is still no official way of implementing vitest with storybook yet. For now, we're going to use `@storybook/jest`

We can implement interaction testing by importing the modules `@storybook/jest` and `@storybook/testing-library`.

There are no huge changes in what we have before when creating a component story. We only need to add the following modules:

```tsx
import { ... } from "@storybook/testing-library";
import { ... } from "@storybook/jest";
```

Remove the `...` and replace with whatever you require in those module.

We also need to have the `play` method added in the story, more information regarding the usage of this method [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function)

```tsx
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/react";
import { within, userEvent } from "@storybook/testing-library";
import { expect } from "@storybook/jest";
import Button from "./Button";

export default {
  title: "Components/Button",
  component: Button,
  tags: ["autodocs"],
  argTypes: {
    onClick: { action: true },
  },
} as Meta<typeof Button>;

type Story = StoryObj<typeof Button>;

export const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    children: "Click Me!",
  },
  // We only need to add the `play` method here
  play: ({ args, canvasElement }) => {
    const canvas = within(canvasElement);
    userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole("button"));
    expect(args.onClick).toHaveBeenCalled();
  },
};
```
